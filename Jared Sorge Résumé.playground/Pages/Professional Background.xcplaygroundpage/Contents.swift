 # Employment History

 # Lyft (Senior iOS Engineer)
 **December 2017 - Present**
 I'm on the Driver Onboarding team, where we are responsible for large portions of reusable workflows utilized by many teams around the company. I joined as a member of the communications platform team, streamlining our notification code and implementing user preferences for their notifications. I've helped to streamline internal tooling, and refactored our statically built settings screens into more flexible and maintainable components.

 # zulily LLC (Senior iOS Engineer)
 **January 2016 - December 2017**
 I was a leader of our mobile team, responsible for adding new features and maintaining our existing codebase. We use a mix of Objective-C and Swift. Our app uses NSOperations, extensive UICollectionViews, and blend both IB as well as building UI programatically. I performed our Swift 3 migration, rebuilt our product detail screen, and have led refactoring to modularize our codebase.

 # University of Washington (Instructor: iOS Apps in Production)
 **June 2016**
 I taught during the summer quarter for the UW. The topics were the app store and in-app purchases, notifications, and app extensions.
 
 # General UI (iOS Developer)
 **July 2015 - January 2016**
 I worked on 2 big projects for General UI: a live streaming video app (think Periscope), and on-site at zulily. I've worked on projects in both Objective-C and an Objective-C/Swift mix. I have helped develop version control procedures and best practices as well. Features that I've worked on have shipped as part of zulily's app, used by millions of customers all over the world.
 
 # Solomon Solution (Technical Consultant)
 **May 2014 - June 2015**
 At Solomon I primarily worked with one client, building for them a customer portal using ASP.NET MVC on the front-end, and ASP.NET Web API 2 on the back-end. I wrote unit-tests for the API component of the project to make sure things were working properly. I prototyped a couple of iOS apps: a customizable bingo game written in Swift, and a simple storefront application.
 
 # MicroK12 (Systems Developer)
 **July 2009 - May 2014**
 Promoted from service to sales in June, 2010. Promoted from sales to development in May, 2012. As a developer I was responsible for updating our sales system using FileMaker Pro, as well as updating and maintaining the website written in PHP. I streamlined the monthly inventory process, which included building an iOS barcode scanner that talked with our REST API. Created an event registration system for an event attended by over 500 people.

 A blog engine that I wrote using Swift and the [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) framework. It uses [textbundle](http://textbundle.org) files for storage, making portability very easy. It generates feeds in multiple formats automatically and can work with full-length content as well as shorter posts without titles. Deploying is automated through Docker, shell scripts, and git.
