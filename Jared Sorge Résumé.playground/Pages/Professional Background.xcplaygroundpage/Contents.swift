 # zulily LLC (Senior iOS Engineer)
 **January 2016 - December 2017**
 I was a leader of our mobile team, responsible for adding new features and maintaining our existing codebase. We use a mix of Objective-C and Swift.

 I worked on 2 big projects for General UI: a live streaming video app (think Periscope), and on-site at zulily. I've worked on projects in both Objective-C and an Objective-C/Swift mix.

 At Solomon I primarily worked with one client, building for them a customer portal using ASP.NET MVC on the front-end, and ASP.NET Web API 2 on the back-end. I wrote unit-tests for the API component of the project to make sure things were working properly. I prototyped a couple of iOS apps: a customizable bingo game written in Swift, and a simple storefront application.
