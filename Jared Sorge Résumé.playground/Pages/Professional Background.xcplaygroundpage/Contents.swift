 # Work History
 
 # University of Washington (Instructor: iOS Apps in Production)
 **June 2016**
 I taught during the summer quarter for the UW. The topics were the app store and in-app purchases, notifications, and app extensions.
 
 # zulily LLC (Senior iOS Engineer)
 **January 2016 - Present**
 I am a leader of our mobile team, responsible for adding new features and maintaining our existing codebase. We use a mix of Objective-C and Swift. Our app uses NSOperations, extensive UICollectionViews, and blend both IB as well as building views programatically. I performed our Swift 3 migration, rebuilt our product detail screen by myself, and always look for ways to improve our codebase.
 
 # General UI (iOS Developer)
 **July 2015 - January 2016**
 I worked on 2 big projects for General UI: a live streaming video app (think Periscope), and on-site at zulily. I've worked on projects in both Objective-C and an Objective-C/Swift mix. I have helped develop version control procedures and best practices as well. Features that I've worked on have shipped as part of zulily's app, used by millions of customers all over the world.
 
 # Solomon Solution (Technical Consultant)
 **May 2014 - June 2015**
 At Solomon I primarily worked with one client, building for them a customer portal using ASP.NET MVC on the front-end, and ASP.NET Web API 2 on the back-end. I wrote unit-tests for the API component of the project to make sure things were working properly. I prototyped a couple of iOS apps: a customizable bingo game written in Swift, and a simple storefront application.
 
 # MicroK12 (Systems Developer)
 **July 2009 - May 2014**
 Promoted from service to sales in June, 2010. Promoted from sales to development in May, 2012. As a developer I was responsible for updating our sales system using FileMaker Pro, as well as updating and maintaining the website written in PHP. I streamlined the monthly inventory process, which included building an iOS barcode scanner that talked with our REST API. Created an event registration system for an event attended by over 500 people.
