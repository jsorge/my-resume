 ## About Me
 
I got my start in programming in early 2012, hoping to learn how to write an iOS app. Frankly, I struggled a lot those first several months as I tried to understand everything that I was reading and watching. Then I found the NSCoders meetup nearby in Seattle, and I met some wonderful people who helped steer me in the right direction. They led me to the University of Washington where I completed a certificate in Mac & iOS development in June, 2014.
 
 During the class I stretched myself beyond merely copying what the instructors had shown. This helped me learn about structure and design of the apps that I would write in the future as well as gave me a better understanding of the pitfalls as well as benefits of splitting things up. I was even able to help classmates with their homework. This validated me and helped me to realize I was going in the right direction.
 
 My full-time iOS career begain in July, 2015. In that time I've been able to work on a wide variety of projects. I really enjoy the ones where I get to build something new. In 2017 year I took on the task of rebuilding zulily's product detail screen using the new architecture that we had been building out since the beginning of 2016. It was a difficult challenge but one that stretched me and was a lot of fun to do.

 Later at zulily I undertook a refactor of how the zulily app can be themed in certain areas via new assets from our API. I was able to break out all of the theme code into its own framework and refactor the interface of callers to be more focused and concise. I love being able to bounce back and forth between UI and more lower level work.

 I took my role at Lyft in December, 2017, where I joined as the first client engineer on the communications platform team. I was able to shore up metrics around deliverability of push notiifications (which greatly increased the business's confidence to use it as a communication channel), and unified our message handling code between our Passenger and Driver apps. I also took a couple of points of friction that I had in my daily workflow and made tools to help ease that pain. One of them became adopted as a primary tool for all iOS engineers to adopt into their workflows.

 I joined the Driver Onboarding team at Lyft in January, 2019. This is a front-end heavy role and we are responsible for large pieces of reusable components that our team uses to onboard new drivers and also supports pieces like the help and support workflows across our apps.
 
 I think the most surprising thing that I've found along this crazy journey is the developer commmunity. While I haven't ventured much outside of Seattle (I haven't made it to a WWDC yet), the people that I've met and grown closer with are really terrific. I've learned a ton from them and hope that I can be a help to others the way they have to me. ]
 
 Thank you for taking some time to review my work here. I hope we can talk soon.
