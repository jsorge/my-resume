 ## About Me
 
I got my start in programming in early 2012, hoping to learn how to write an iOS app. Frankly, I struggled a lot those first several months as I tried to understand everything that I was reading and watching. Then I found the NSCoders meetup nearby in Seattle, and I met some wonderful people who helped steer me in the right direction. They led me to the University of Washington where I completed a certificate in Mac & iOS development in June, 2014.
 
 During the class I stretched myself beyond merely copying what the instructors had shown. This helped me learn about structure and design of the apps that I would write in the future as well as gave me a better understanding of the pitfalls as well as benefits of splitting things up. I was even able to help classmates with their homework. This validated me and helped me to realize I was going in the right direction.
 
 Over the last few years as I've been able to work as an iOS developer full-time I have worked on many projects. I really enjoy the ones where I get to build something new. This year I took on the task of rebuilding our product detail screen using the new architecture that us at zulily have been building out since the beginning of 2016. It was a difficult challenge but one that stretched me and was a lot of fun to do.

 Recently I undertook a refactor of how the zulily app can be themed in certain areas via new assets from our API. I was able to break out all of the theme code into its own framework and refactor the interface of callers to be more focused and concise. I love being able to bounce back and forth between UI and more lower level work.
 
 I think the most surprising thing that I've found along this crazy journey is the developer commmunity. While I haven't ventured much outside of Seattle (I haven't made it to a WWDC yet), the people that I've met and grown closer with are really terrific. I've learned a ton from them and hope that I can be a help to others the way they have to me. ]
 
 In looking for a new place to work I want to go somewhere with an amazing team that I can learn from and contribute to. This is such a fun career to be in and I deeply enjoy participating in rich discussions about architectures, good user interfaces, and the craft of app building.
 
 Thank you for taking some time to review my work here. I hope we can talk soon.
