### About {#about}

I'm hoping to find a great team of talented developers who I can learn from and contribute to so that we can build the best software together.

I taught during the summer quarter for the UW. The topics were the app store and in-app purchases, notifications, and app extensions.

zulily LLC
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**January 2016 - Present**
I am a leader of our mobile team, responsible for adding new features and maintaining our existing codebase. We use a mix of Objective-C and Swift.

I worked on 2 big projects for General UI: a live streaming video app (think Periscope), and on-site at zulily. I've worked on projects in both Objective-C and an Objective-C/Swift mix. I have helped develop version control procedures and best practices as well. Features that I've worked on have shipped as part of zulily's app, used by millions of customers all over the world.

**May 2014 - June 2015**
At Solomon I primarily worked with one client, building for them a customer portal using ASP.NET MVC on the front-end, and ASP.NET Web API 2 on the back-end. I wrote unit-tests for the API component of the project to make sure things were working properly. I prototyped a couple of iOS apps: a customizable bingo game written in Swift, and a simple storefront application.
