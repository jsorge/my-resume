### Work History {#work-history}

Lyft
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**December 2017 - May 2020**
At Lyft I contributed to the codebases for both Rider and Driver apps, creating reusable workflows that were originally for my team (Driver Onboarding) but were utilized around the company. These were primarily camera-based for things like scanning a driver's license or taking a profile picture. I helped usher in our move to a modularized codebase by writing a tool to let developers make new modules, and added tooling to bring our code into a Swift Playground for rapid iteration.

University of Washington
: *Instructor: iOS Apps in Production*
**June 2016**
I taught during the summer quarter for the UW. The topics were the app store and in-app purchases, notifications, and app extensions.

zulily
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**January 2016 - December 2017**
I was a leader of our mobile team, responsible for adding new features and maintaining our existing codebase. We use a mix of Objective-C and Swift. Our app makes heavy use of NSOperations, UICollectionViews, and blend both IB as well as building views programatically. I performed our Swift 3 migration, rebuilt our product detail screen by myself, and always look for ways to improve our codebase.

General UI
: *iOS Developer*
**July 2015 - January 2016**
I worked on 2 big projects for General UI: a live streaming video app (think Periscope), and on-site at zulily. I worked on projects in both Objective-C and an Objective-C/Swift mix. I also helped develop version control procedures and best practices as well. Features that I've worked on have shipped as part of zulily's app, used by millions of customers all over the world.

Solomon Solution
: *Technical Consultant*
**May 2014 - June 2015**
At Solomon I primarily worked with one client, building for them a customer portal using ASP.NET MVC on the front-end, and ASP.NET Web API 2 on the back-end. I wrote unit-tests for the API component of the project to make sure things were working properly. I prototyped a couple of iOS apps: a customizable bingo game written in Swift, and a simple storefront application.
