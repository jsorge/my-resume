### Work History {#work-history}

Adobe
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**March 2022 - Present**
I joined Adobe to build a new video editor for iOS â€“ Project Violet. On that project we use SwiftUI and AVFoundation to do most of the work, with some UIKit sprinkled in as well. I created the feature to adjust the speed of a clip while editing on the timeline and as part of that work I built out a custom slider control that will be used across Adobe's mobile apps.

Zulily
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**June 2020 - February 2022**
I rejoined Zulily and became part of the Core Site & Apps team. We are infrastructure-focused, and I've done projects to help support our mobile apps. On the iOS side I've implemented programatic project generation with Tuist to enable modularizing our codebase, migrated our dependencies to Swift Package Manager for easy management, and streamlined our Continuous Integration processes with Jenkins and Fastlane. More broadly I've built tooling to automate building new app releases for both iOS and Android and created a weekly release cadence to ensure reliable app delivery. Lastly I completely rebuilt our analytics and networking stacks in the iOS app to be modernized, built using Swift with overlays for legacy Objective-C compatibility.

Lyft
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**December 2017 - May 2020**
At Lyft I contributed to the codebases for both Rider and Driver apps, creating reusable workflows that were originally for my team (Driver Onboarding) but were utilized around the company. These were primarily camera-based for things like scanning a driver's license or taking a profile picture. I helped usher in our move to a modularized codebase by writing a tool to let developers make new modules, and added tooling to bring our code into a Swift Playground for rapid iteration.

University of Washington
: *Instructor: iOS Apps in Production*
**June 2016**
I taught during the summer quarter for the UW. The topics were the app store and in-app purchases, notifications, and app extensions.

zulily
: *Senior iOS Engineer*
**January 2016 - December 2017**
I was a leader of our mobile team, responsible for adding new features and maintaining our existing codebase. We use a mix of Objective-C and Swift. Our app makes heavy use of NSOperations, UICollectionViews, and blend both IB as well as building views programatically. I performed our Swift 3 migration, rebuilt our product detail screen by myself, and always look for ways to improve our codebase.
